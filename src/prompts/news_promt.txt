4. Return the result strictly as ONE JSON object without any
   comments or formatting. The structure must match the example below.

```json
{{
  "summary": "Brief description of the key drivers of the day.",
  "impact": {{
    "TICKER1": 1,
    "TICKER2": -2,
    "INDEX1": -1
  }}
}}
```

-3 = sharply negative, -2 = moderately negative, -1 = slightly negative,
 0 = no effect,
+1 = slightly positive, +2 = moderately positive, +3 = sharply positive.
